## Experimenting with Matplotlib, Numpy, Fast.ai, PyTorch.

## ISLP
To use the ISLP package please enable env2 virtual env:
```bash
source env2/bin/activate
```
The reason for this is ISLP requires distutils which is not supported
in python3.12. env2 uses python3.10 rather than 3.12.

## What is this repository?
This repository contains all of code-based studying for ML related mathematics. Eventually I will include my drawing notes although I am yet to find the best way to present these here *(e.g. images would be too static, something more interactive is preferred)*.
