Name five areas where deep learning is now the best in the world:
- Colorizing images.
- Folding proteins.
- Image recogniztion (categorization, classification).
- NLP (answering questions, summarizing documents).
- Playing ATARI video games, and physical games (chess, go).

What was the name of the first device that was based on the principle of the artificial neuron?
The perceptron was modelled on neurons. Dendrites map to input variables, and the nucleus
is a function that generates a singular output which maps to the axon.

Based on the book of the same name, what are the requirements for parallel distributed processing (PDP)?
- A set of processing units (neurons).
- A state of activation (output On/Off).
- An output function for every unit (activation function).
- A pattern of connectivity among units (layers can be bijective).
- A propagation rule for propagating patterns of activities through the network of connectivities (feed forward?).
- An activation rule for combining the inputs impinging on a unit with the current state of that unit to produce an output for the unit (ReLu, Threshold, tanh).
- A learning rule whereby patterns of connectivity are modified by experience (SGD?).
- An environment within which the system must operate (computer, GPU).

What were the two theoretical misunderstandings that held back the field of neural networks?
- Networks could not learn certain functions like XOR.
- Additional layers could help fix this learning bottleneck.

What is a GPU?
- A GPU is a graphics processing unit that typically performs computations
related to drawing, rendering, and manipulating objects (graphics). Some operations
include rotating, coordinate transformations from one coordinate space to another, coloring.

Open a notebook and execute a cell containing: 1+1. What happens?
- 2 is output beneath the executing cell.

Why is it hard to use a traditional computer program to recognize images in a photo?
- It is difficult to encode the ways humans use pattern recognition and banks of familiar shapes
to piece together and recognize an object within milliseconds.

What did Samuel mean by "weight assignment"?
- Samuel is suggesting assigning some variables (coefficients) which represent a configuration for
how a model will perform. Then discovering better values (automatically) for those weights that
increase the performance of the learning model.

What term do we normally use in deep learning for what Samuel called "weights"?
- Parameters.

Why is it hard to understand why a deep learning model makes a particular prediction?
- Models can have hundreds of layers which makes it difficult to reach a sensible conclusion
how a certain prediction was reached.

What is the name of the theorem that shows that a neural network can solve any mathematical problem to any level of accuracy?
- Universal approximation theorem.

What do you need in order to train a model?
- Training set, validation set, test set. Network architecture.
