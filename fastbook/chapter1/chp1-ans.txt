Do you need these for deep learning?

Lots of math T / F = F
Lots of data T / F = F
Lots of expensive computers T / F = F
A PhD T / F = F

Name five areas where deep learning is now the best in the world:
- Colorizing images.
- Folding proteins.
- Image recogniztion (categorization, classification).
- NLP (answering questions, summarizing documents).
- Playing ATARI video games, and physical games (chess, go).

What was the name of the first device that was based on the principle of the artificial neuron?
The perceptron was modelled on neurons. Dendrites map to input variables, and the nucleus
is a function that generates a singular output which maps to the axon.

Based on the book of the same name, what are the requirements for parallel distributed processing (PDP)?
- A set of processing units (neurons).
- A state of activation (output On/Off).
- An output function for every unit (activation function).
- A pattern of connectivity among units (layers can be bijective).
- A propagation rule for propagating patterns of activities through the network of connectivities (feed forward?).
- An activation rule for combining the inputs impinging on a unit with the current state of that unit to produce an output for the unit (ReLu, Threshold, tanh).
- A learning rule whereby patterns of connectivity are modified by experience (SGD?).
- An environment within which the system must operate (computer, GPU).

What were the two theoretical misunderstandings that held back the field of neural networks?
- Networks could not learn certain functions like XOR.
- Additional layers could help fix this learning bottleneck.

What is a GPU?
- A GPU is a graphics processing unit that typically performs computations
related to drawing, rendering, and manipulating objects (graphics). Some operations
include rotating, coordinate transformations from one coordinate space to another, coloring.

Open a notebook and execute a cell containing: 1+1. What happens?
- 2 is output beneath the executing cell.
