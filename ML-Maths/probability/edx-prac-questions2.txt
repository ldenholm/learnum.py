Two chess players, A and B, are going to play 7 games. Each game has three possible outcomes: a win for A (which is a loss for B), a draw (tie), and a loss for A (which is a win for B). A win is worth  point, a draw is worth  points, and a loss is worth  points.

For A to end up with {WWWDDLL}

We don't care in which order these outcomes occur we just want the total number of combinations.

So 7! permutations exist, and we divide by 1/(3!2!2!) to remove the overcounted combinations.
