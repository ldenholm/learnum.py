N = total num elk
m = subset size of recapture

N-n = total untagged elk

probability that exactly k of the m elk in the sample were previously tagged?

denominator = nCm

numerator = all combinations we can choose a k tagged elk from the initial subset of n in the sample
space.

so nCk = the combinations to pick k tagged elk from the total tagged subset n

for each set of k tagged elk we can pick there are all the incorrect combinations
of picking a non tagged elk, so we have (N-n)Choose(m-k) possibilities



Problem 1a
1 point possible (graded)
(a) How many 7-digit phone numbers are possible, assuming that the first digit can’t be a 0 or a 1?

So for the last 6 digits:
10 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10, possible numbers

the choices for the first digit = 8

ans = 8 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10

correct yay!

Problem 1b
1 point possible (graded)
(b) Re-solve the previous problem, except now assume also that the phone number is not allowed to start with 911.

Find how many ways there are to pick 911 from 10. Order matters and we are overcounting by a
factor of 2!.

We actually can hopefully just do:

9 * 9 * 9 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 <-- this is incorrect.

We know the last part is going to be (10C10)^4 which is equivalent to 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 

So we still only have 8 choices for the first number, then
(8 * 10 * 10) = possible choices for first three digits, however we cannot have 911
so subtract 1 to account for that combination.

((8 * 10 * 10) -1) * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10
