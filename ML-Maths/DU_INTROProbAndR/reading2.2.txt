A standard deck of 52 playing cards is shuffled well. 
Two cards are drawn randomly, one at a time without replacement.
Let A be the event that the first card is a heart, and B be the event that the second card is red. Find P(A|B) and P(B|A).

Probability the first card is a heart GIVEN that the second card is a red?
Well hearts are all red. How many red cards exist in a deck?
26/52. How many hearts exist in a deck? 13.

We are given the formula:
P(A|B) = P(A ^ B) / P(B)

Basically does the order matter?

So let's solve for A: We need to find P(A ^ B).

P(A ^ B) = These are dependent events.
P(A ^ B) = total number of favourable outcomes / total outcomes

(13 / 52) * (25 / 51) = 25 / 204. You have to multiply the probabilities
with eachother because the events are dependent.

Next find the probability of event B: P(B) = 


A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles.
Two marbles are drawn at random without replacement.
If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability the second marble is blue?

7 marbles in total. A = 1st marble is red. B = second marble is blue.
3/7 * 4/6 = 3 / 7 * 2 / 3 = 6 / 21 = 2 / 7
